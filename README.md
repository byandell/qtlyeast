QTL Analysis of Brem Kruglyak Yeast Data

This R package is too large for CRAN (~15Mb). To install, first do

> install.packages(devtools)

If on Windows, you will then need to install Rtools from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools.
This is an executable that will install some applications in c:\Rtools.

> library(devtools)

> install_github("qtlyeast", "byandell")

Alternatively, you can visit http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~yandell/statgen/qtlyeast
and pick up the current source (*.tar.gz) or Windows read (*.zip) package.
